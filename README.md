# BAplotteR: Create Bland-Altman Plots for Method Comparison

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/BAplotteR](https://shinyappstore.com/a/BAplotteR)__

BA-plotteR is a tool for creating Bland-Altman plots, commonly used in assessing agreement between two different measurement methods. Also known as Tukey mean-difference plots, they were popularized in medical statistics by Bland and Altman. These plots help analyze quantitative differences between paired data from repeated measurements. They're particularly useful when comparing two methods applied to the same subject. BA-plotteR generates various visualizations for quantitative comparisons, based on the Bland-Altman plot principles. To use the tool effectively, it's recommended to familiarize oneself with the methods outlined in papers by Bland and Altman (1986, 1999). More information about the app can be found in the publication "BA-plotteR â€“ A web tool for generating Bland-Altman plots and constructing limits of agreement" by Goedhart and Rishniw (2021).
